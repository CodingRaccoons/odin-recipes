      <h2>
        Banh mi sandwiches are a Vietnamese street food that originated in Saigon. 
        Served on soft French baguettes, they are a delicious hybrid of French and Vietnamese cuisine. 
        Typically, they contain pickled carrots, daikon, chiles, cucumber slices, cilantro, mayo, and a protein. 
        Popular proteins include marinated pork, chicken, and paté, but I use tofu in this recipe to make it vegetarian.

        <li>1 (12 inch) French baguette</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced cucumber</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves</li>

      <h4>
        <strong>Steps</strong> 
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool.</li> 
        <li>Place carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture and let marinate at least 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While vegetables marinate, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Place chicken on the prepared pan and broil, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on a cutting board. Cut into bite-sized piece</li>
        <li>Slice baguette in half lengthwise. Pull out the soft center of the bread, leaving a cavity for the fillings</li>
        <li>Lightly toast baguette under the broiler, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain off excess vinegar mixture after vegetables have marinated.</li>
        <li>To assemble the sandwich, spread each half of toasted baguette with mayonnaise. Layer chicken on the bottom half of the bread. Top with cucumber, drained pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalapeno. Squeeze lime wedge over fillings and cover with top half of baguette.</li>
        <li>Cut into two 6-inch sandwiches to serve.</li>
      </ol>
