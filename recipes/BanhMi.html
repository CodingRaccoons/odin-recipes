      <h2>
        Banh mi sandwiches are a Vietnamese street food that originated in Saigon. 
        Served on soft French baguettes, they are a delicious hybrid of French and Vietnamese cuisine. 
        Typically, they contain pickled carrots, daikon, chiles, cucumber slices, cilantro, mayo, and a protein. 
        Popular proteins include marinated pork, chicken, and paté, but I use tofu in this recipe to make it vegetarian.
